# Face-Recognition-System
This project is a Face Recognition system built using Python. It uses OpenCV and face recognition libraries to detect and recognize faces in real-time. The system captures live video from a webcam and identifies known faces based on a trained dataset. It applies deep learning techniques to ensure high accuracy and speed.
